# GOLOVA

[The game on itch.io](https://where-is-your-keyboard.itch.io/golova)


This is a little remake of the Golova puzzle game from here: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51/$300077

All assets (sprites and audio) are taken from this project. The game itself has been remade using C and Raylib.
